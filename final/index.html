        <p style="font-size: 35px;"> The Problem, by the Numbers </p>
        <p>A common misconception is that New York City is a gun-violence heavy place, often deterring people from living there. This has been proven untrue. While violent crime remains an issue in several spots of the city, New York City actually has one of the lowest violent crime rates compared to other large American cities. 2025 has proved just that. 2025 has seen some of the lowest shootings in the New York City boroughs to date. The State of New York released a data set to data.gov that shows the amount of shootings that had occurred over the course of 2025. </p>
        <p>It reached record-levels of low. According to nyc.gov, May 2025 was the “Safest May in Recorded History for Shootings and Murders”. May 2025 also saw the safest memorial day on record. The city recorded the lowest number shootings ever across the entire weekend. This was also the first ever Memorial Day Sunday with no shootings (New York City Police Department, 2025). </p>
        <p> The Bronx is often considered the “most violent” borough, often having the most prevalent issue of gun violence. It still sees the most amount of shootings, although in 2025 the numbers were also record low. </p>

      <p>One way to decipher these new record-low statistics is to take a look at the amount of community based programs that have been put in place in NYC. These programs work to target basic issues like health, education, and crime. And according to the New York City Council, “ It is possible that such interventions may be just as effective, if not more, at lowering long-term crime rates than traditional approaches to public safety”. </p>

      <p>I spoke with Michael Ivory, the Director of Communications at the Office of the Bronx Borough President. Michael emphasized the importance of one program- The Crisis Management System in the Bronx. According to him, “This system deploys teams of credible messengers who mediate conflicts on the street and connect high-risk individuals to services that can reduce the long-term risk of violence”. Michael also explained the Crisis Management Organizations that work under this system. Those are save Our Streets/SOS/Center for Court Innovation, Bronx Connect/Release the Grip/BRAG, and Guns Down, Life Up.</p>

      <p> Additionally, the Bronx Borough President has recently allocated around $400k for security cameras and other public safety measures. President Vanessa L Gibson allocated exactly $395,000 toward installing security cameras in areas of the Bronx as well as deploying a “Mobile Command Van” to support law enforcement officers. According to The Bronx Times, the cameras will be  placed strategically in areas with elevated crime rates, while the Mobile Command Van will enable the NYPD to respond swiftly to emergencies”. There will also be security cameras implemented in Bronx schools to enhance safety for students and teachers.</p>

        <p>In this dataset, there was a column showing the location types for which the shootings happened. As shown by this bar graph, the most common type of locations were streets. It is clear that safety efforts that are being implemented in the Bronx should target streets. The surveillance technology that is being implemented should be put in on street corners, and on buildings facing streets. The cameras should also aim to capture areas that are not usually seen by the public eye, such as around corners and down dark alleyways, where shootings are prone to happen.</p>

      With a dataset like this, it is important to keep safety measures in mind. Bronx citizens who enact their own safety measures are less likely to become victims of a shooting. Some safety measures that citizens should take are:
